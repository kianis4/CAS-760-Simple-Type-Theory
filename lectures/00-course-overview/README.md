## 📝 Lecture Notes

### What is Simple Type Theory?

**Definition (from slides):**
- A classical version of higher-order logic extending first-order logic
- Church introduced practical form in 1940 (Church's type theory)
- Tailored for reasoning with functions
- Alonzo = version that admits undefined expressions

**Why STT?**
- Practical logic for expressing mathematical ideas
- Foundation for proof assistants and math software
- Handles partial functions and definite descriptions
