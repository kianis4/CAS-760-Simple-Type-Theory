## 🎯 Learning Objectives

**Knowledge:**
- [ ] Define theory as pair $T = (L, \Gamma)$ with language and axioms
- [ ] Distinguish theory closure $\overline{T}$ (all theorems) from axioms
- [ ] Write theory definition modules (name, language, axioms)
- [ ] Define theory extensions: $T_1 \leq T_2$
- [ ] Define conservative extension: no new theorems in original language
- [ ] Distinguish definitional vs specificational extensions
- [ ] Explain recursive definition schemes
- [ ] Define categorical theories (unique model up to isomorphism)
- [ ] State Gödel's First Incompleteness Theorem for Alonzo
- [ ] Explain essential incompleteness of sufficiently strong theories

**Skills:**
- [ ] Write theories for: Monoids, Groups, Partial Orders, PA
- [ ] Extend theories conservatively
- [ ] Determine if a theory is categorical
