## 💡 M&M Writing Tips

### For "Meaningful/Memorable":
- What concept clicked for you this week?
- What surprised you?
- What connection did you make to other knowledge?
- Example: "This week, the concept of undefinedness in Alonzo finally made sense to me. I realized it's similar to how division by zero is handled in programming, but formalized in the logic itself."

### For "Not Understood":
- Be specific about what you don't understand
- This helps the instructor know where to clarify
- Example: "I'm struggling to understand the difference between general and standard semantics. Specifically, why do we need both?"

### For "Course Feedback":
- Be constructive
- What's working well?
- What could be improved?
- Example: "The pace of the lectures has been good, but I would appreciate more worked examples during class."
